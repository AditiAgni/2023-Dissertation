Transcriptome analysis of E2A-PBX1 associated gene clusters for determination of its regulatory effects in acute lymphoblastic leukaemia

Aim: To perform transcriptome analysis of E2A-PBX1 associated gene clusters for determination of its regulatory effects in acute lymphoblastic leukaemia.

Data type: Microarray gene expression data from publicly available platform

Packages used: Refer the scripts (libraries)

About the script The acute lymphoblastic leukaemia gene expression data was processed and used for gene clustering and relating clusters with E2A-PBX1 translocation. The numbers before the title of the script indicate the sequence in which analysis was performed. Below are the details of the analysis:

    Data processing and annotation: The gene expression data was processed with respect to the different platforms and annotated with the help biomart.

    Creating metafile: A metafile was created that contained the processed datasets combined on the basis of the gene symbols. differential gene expression was performed to determine DEGs and the metafile was unmerged again into respective individual datasets. these datasets were subjected to DGE again.
    
    Heterogeneity analysis: the top table obtained from DGE of all datasets were merged. the forest plots and funnel plots were drawn to determine the outliers.
    
    WGCNA: the outlier datasets were removed and gene custers were made. the modules were related with traits and genes correlated to E2A-PBX1 were extracted.
